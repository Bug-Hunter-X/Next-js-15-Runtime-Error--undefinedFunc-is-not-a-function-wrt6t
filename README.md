# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: undefinedFunc is not a function

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications. The error occurs when a route attempts to call a function that is not defined.

## Bug
The `about.js` file calls a function `undefinedFunc` which is not defined anywhere in the codebase. This results in a runtime error when the `/about` route is accessed.

## Solution
The solution involves defining the `undefinedFunc` function before calling it. In this case we can either define it in `about.js` or import it from another module.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/about` in your browser.
5. Observe the runtime error.

## How to Solve
1. Review `about.js` file and ensure that all functions are defined.
2. If you are using an external library, ensure it is installed and imported correctly.
3. If you're unsure where the error is coming from, check the browser's developer console for additional clues.
